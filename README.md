# span-map
Map span of scalar value to some data.

A data structure that maps spans (ranges) of scalar values to sets of data. Each
span represents an interval with start and end bounds, which can be inclusive,
exclusive, or unbounded.

## Features
- Support for inclusive, exclusive and unbounded bounds
- Efficient range queries
- Support for overlapping spans
- Generic over key and value types
- Thread-safe with standard Rust thread safety guarantees

## Usage

```rust
use span_map::SpanMap;

let mut map = SpanMap::<i32, String>::new();

// Map span (-âˆž, 5] to "a"
map.insert(..=5, "a".to_string());

// Map span [3, 7) to "b"
map.insert(3..7, "b".to_string());

// Get values at point 4
let values: Vec<_> = map.get(&4).collect();
assert_eq!(values, vec!["a", "b"]); // Point 4 is in both spans
```
